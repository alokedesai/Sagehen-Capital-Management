          Sagehen Capital Management (SCM) is a student group that manages an investment partnership called Sagehen Capital, LP.
          The assets in the partnership belong to two alumni who in the early 1980â€™s were involved in what was then called the Pomona College Investment Club. At the end of each year, a part of the fund is donated to the Pomona College Economics Department.
          The amount of the donations more or less tracks the profits generated by the fund (more or less because during years were the fund incurs losses, donations have historically continued.) The assets of the fund have fluctuated between $650,000 and $1,200,000. Total funds transferred to the college for 2007, 2008, and 2009 are $159,633.
